  // Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle

Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k

(inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards

represented as an array using only swaps.



It should run in O(N) time.



Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.
